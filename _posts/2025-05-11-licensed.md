Phew, I finally received my electrical license from New South Wales, Australia! And what does this actually mean? To be honest, not much to me—but I won’t deny it’s one less problem to worry about. After all, since the day I arrived in Australia (February 3, 2018), I haven’t had a single break.

It’s been a long journey, and my mood swings like a sinusoidal wave, with ups and downs. On the other hand, my growth as a professional, a human being, and most importantly, a family man follows a steadily rising linear path. I’m deeply grateful for everything life has given me because, no matter how hard things seem, I’m still here — giving my best every day and striving for a better tomorrow.
