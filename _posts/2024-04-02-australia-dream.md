# Australia Dream

On January 31, 2018, I boarded at Guarulhos Airport, in SÃ£o Paulo, bound for Sydney, Australia. That would be my first plane trip and my first international experience.

The desire to spend time in another country began in 2014, with the difference that at the time the destination was Dublin, Ireland.

That year, I was nearing the end of my cycle at the English school I had enrolled in the year before. The course lasted a year and a half, with an effective methodology and teaching material that emphasized the importance of the student's commitment to studying two to three hours a day. Unfortunately, in the same year, an unexpected loss caused a great shock and plans to undertake the trip had to be aborted.

In 2017, the company where I provided services closed and, given the not very favorable business situation, I began to reconsider the possibility of doing an exchange. My goal was to improve my English, gain experience abroad and return with new ideas to execute a new project.

The exchange company I used at the time was 2be Study. The service, in general, was enough for me to take an important step towards my desire.

**The amounts spent were:**
