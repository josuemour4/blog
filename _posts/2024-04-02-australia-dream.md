# Australia Dream

On January 31, 2018, I boarded at Guarulhos Airport, in SÃ£o Paulo, bound for Sydney, Australia. That would be my first plane trip and my first international experience.

The desire to spend time in another country began in 2014, with the difference that at the time the destination was Dublin, Ireland.

That year, I was nearing the end of my cycle at the English school I had enrolled in the year before. The course lasted a year and a half, with an effective methodology and teaching material that emphasized the importance of the student's commitment to studying two to three hours a day. Unfortunately, in the same year, an unexpected loss caused a great shock and plans to undertake the trip had to be aborted.

In 2017, the company where I provided services closed and, given the not very favorable business situation, I began to reconsider the possibility of doing an exchange. My goal was to improve my English, gain experience abroad and return with new ideas to execute a new project.

The exchange company I used at the time was 2be Study. The service, in general, was enough for me to take an important step towards my desire.

**The amounts spent were:**

## On Australian soil

Upon setting foot on Australian soil, a wave of intoxicating emotions overcame me. Joy overflowed in my heart, and with each step, the desire to live every second of this unique experience intensified. The vastness of the country opened up before me, an irresistible invitation to explore new horizons and immerse myself in a rich and vibrant culture.

Soon after disembarking the plane, my first steps took me to a huge line that formed in front of the immigration agent. There were 42 hours of flight time, with connections in Dubai and Bangkok. So a few more minutes wouldn't make a difference. During this break, I had the opportunity to observe my surroundings, meeting several interesting people, including other Brazilians not too far away. In the blink of an eye, it was my turn to present the documents and officially enter Australia.

In the airport parking lot, someone was already waiting for me to take me to the house where I would spend a total of four weeks. The residence was shared with three other people, all Brazilian, and like me, full of expectations.

On February 5, 2018, two days after my arrival in Australia, I had my first day of classes at Bridge Business College. After a simple screening, I was placed in an intermediate level class, with five other students of different nationalities, including Japan, South Korea, Spain, Slovakia and Brazil.

Living with people from such diverse cultures was a unique experience for me. Despite being the oldest in the room, my enthusiasm was evident. I felt my eyes sparkle as I observed my classmates. It truly was an amazing experience.

The teacher leading the classes was Australian, a wonderful person who understood the challenges of learning a new language, as she was proficient in another language besides English. I believe this experience contributed to her exceptional skill as a professional, as she demonstrated great patience in explaining and utilized a variety of methods to teach the content effectively.

The course lasted for 4 months, with classes from 8:30 AM to 1:30 PM. During the initial months, I made sure to seize every opportunity to improve my English, whether in the classroom, on excursions, or anywhere else I could practice the language. After all, Portuguese was no longer predominant around me, and English intertwined with other languages, such as Mandarin, which was very prevalent in the Sydney region, especially in the suburb of Artamon, where I lived.
