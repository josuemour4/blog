At the end of last year, I applied for my proficiency certificate. To date, I have not yet received an email from the responsible agency reviewing my documents to inform me whether the documents I submitted are sufficient to issue the document required to obtain my full electrician's license.

Since this has not yet occurred, I am considering the possibility of having to take the final test. For this reason, I will write a few posts related to the content that will possibly be covered in the test.

As the title already indicates, this post will be about the MEN (Multiple Earthed Neutral) system.

In the book AS/NZS 3000:2018, in item 5.3 EARTHING SYSTEM PARTS clause 5.3.1 General says:

The protective earthing arrangement for an electrical installation providing protection by means of automatic disconnection of supply and connected to the MEN system of distribution shall include the following parts: 

A) **Protective earthing conductors connecting exposed conductive parts as required.**  
    - Cables that connect exposed metal parts (such as appliance casings) to the grounding system.  
B) **Main earthing conductor.**  
    - The main wire that connects the entire grounding system to earth.  
C) **Main earthing terminal, connection or bar.**  
    - The central point where all grounding conductors meet.  
D) **MEN connection between the main earthing terminal, connection or bar and the supply neutral bar.**   
    - A connection between the main grounding terminal and the neutral bus of the power supply, to ensure that the neutral and earth are connected correctly.   
E) **Earth electrode.**  
    - A device (usually a metal rod) buried in the ground that connects the grounding system   
F) **Equipotential bonding of extraneous conductive and other parts as required.**
    - Connections that ensure that all metal parts that are not part of the electrical system (such as water and gas pipes) are at the same electrical potential, preventing electric shock.


Examples of the parts of the MEN system of earthing are shown in Figures 5.1 and 5.2.
