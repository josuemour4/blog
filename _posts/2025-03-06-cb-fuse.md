**Protection devices - Circuit breaker and fuse**

Electrical protection devices play a fundamental role in ensuring the safety and functionality of electrical systems, acting as preventive barriers against a range of risks associated with the use of electrical energy. These components or systems are meticulously designed to detect, interrupt, or mitigate failures, short circuits, overloads, and other anomalies that could compromise the integrity of electrical installations, connected equipment, and, most importantly, the safety of individuals interacting with these systems.

The importance of these devices lies in their ability to prevent severe consequences, such as electrical fires, irreparable damage to sensitive equipment, and, above all, electric shocks that can endanger lives.

Among the most common protection devices are circuit breakers, which act as automatic switches, shutting off the circuit when they detect an electrical current exceeding safe limits. Fuses, on the other hand, are components that melt in the event of an overload, interrupting the flow of current.

The proper selection and installation of these devices require specialized technical knowledge, as they must be sized according to the specific characteristics of each installation, such as electrical load, circuit type, and applicable technical standards.

In addition to providing immediate protection, electrical devices also contribute to sustainability and resource efficiency. By preventing equipment damage and reducing the occurrence of fires, they minimize material and financial losses, as well as reduce energy waste.

Beyond their primary function of preventing accidents and damage, electrical protection devices are essential for facilitating maintenance and repairs in existing installations, as they allow for the safe and controlled interruption of power flow in the workplace, ensuring that professionals can carry out their activities without the risk of electric shocks or accidental re-energization of the circuit.

I believe it is clear how important it is to use protective devices in electrical installations. But before we go any further, below is a table showing the most common types of faults.

<div class="table-wrapper">
  <table class="alt">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="3"><b>Electrical Current – Terms and Definitions</b></th>

      <tr>
        <td>Overcurrent</td>
        <td>Any current exceeding the rated value.</td>
        <td>Overload currents, fault currents and short-circuit currents are all different types of overcurrent.
        <ul>
            <li>Overload – when too many devices are turned on at the same time;</li>
            <li>Short circuit – low resistance path between live conductor and neutral or ground;</li>
            <li>Equipment failures – stalled motors, damaged cables, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Overload Current</td>
        <td>An overcurrent occurring in a circuit that is electrically sound.</td>
        <td>An excessive current that is drawn when a motor is used to drive a mechanical load that is beyond its design capability.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fault Current</td>
        <td>A current resulting from an insulation failure or from the bridging of insulation.</td>
        <td>Current that flows when unintended contact occurs between any two conductors, e.g. active and earth.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Short-Circuit Current</td>
        <td>A fault current resulting from a fault of negligible impedance between live conductors.</td>
        <td>Current that flows when unintended contact occurs between phases, or between phase and neutral conductors.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
