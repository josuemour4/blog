This project aims to offer an employee management tool for companies with a low budget. 

I am the only person behind all the work, so the estimated time for completing this system is uncertain. Initially, the characteristics that are implemented in this project are:
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
**Recursos Principais**:

1. **Employee Registration**: The system will allow detailed employee registration, including personal information, contact details, employment history and relevant documentation.

2. **Schedule and Time Management**: Employees will be able to record their working hours and request time off directly in the system. Managers will be able to manage or refuse the regulation and monitor the record of hours worked.

3. **Task and Project Management**: It will be possible to deliver tasks and projects to employees, set deadlines and monitor work progress. Employees will be able to update the status of tasks assigned to them, facilitating communication and collaboration within the team.

4. **Document Storage**: The system will provide a secure location to store important documents such as employment contracts, benefits forms and employee training certificates.

5. **Reports and Analysis**: Managers will be able to generate detailed reports on employee attendance, hours worked, individual performance and other relevant statistics. This will help in making informed decisions and strategic planning.


**Guiding principles**:

- **Accessibility**: The system will be developed with an easy-to-use and accessible interface to ensure that low-budget companies can easily implement and utilize it.

- **Flexibility**: It will be modular and configurable, allowing companies to customize the system according to their specific employee management needs.

- **Security**: Security of employee data will be a priority, with robust security measures in place to protect confidential information.

- **Open Source**: The project will be licensed as open source, allowing other companies and developers to contribute improvements and customizations.
